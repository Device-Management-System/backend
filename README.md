## Problem Core

Businesses lose track of who is using what IT hardware and devices, purchase costs, and sim tariff details when using existing methods.

2.  Save equipment managers time when loaning out and tracking devices
3.  Give Accounting/Finance more insight into IT assets and capital expenses.

## Solution

**Core suggested Features**

- A dashboard of devices in the company and who they are assigned to
- Ability to search for devices by a code number
- Ability to search for a person and find their devices
- A nice aesthetic for each device time, to make a pleasant and intuitive experience
- View History of a person's loaned devices
- View history of a device's loan history
- Allow an employee to submit a request to loan equipment
